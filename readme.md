# Bulk Images to Posts

Bulk upload images to create posts / custom posts with featured images.

New posts are created using the file name of the image as the post title.

You can select the post type and a taxonmy for uploading the images to.

## This fork differs and does

* Uploads images from flickr to wordpress
* The flickr images are downloaded with https://flickrdownloadr.com/ with corresponding json objects
* The implementation is just a quick fix with hard coded variables. It's not made for general use
* I've set up a local wordpress install where I upload all images and it's easier to make changes in local wordpress before uploading it to my site
